# Connecting a New AI Agent to IWE

> Audience: a pilot who wants to connect **any** AI agent vendor to their fork of `FMT-exocortex-template` — Claude Code, Kimi Code, Codex, Hermes, a ChatGPT extension, or any other file-based CLI/IDE agent not yet covered by a dedicated guide.
> Time: ~15–30 minutes, depending on whether the agent supports MCP out of the box.
> Verified in practice (28.07.2026) on 4 different agents simultaneously (Claude, Kimi, Codex, Hermes) — coordination on shared files with no conflicts.

This document is written so that **the agent itself** (not only the human) can read it and complete the connection independently — without assuming anything is "already known" about a specific vendor.

## What You Will Get

- When the new agent opens the repository, it will read `AGENTS.md` and apply the common IWE rules.
- If the agent edits repository files at the same time as other agents, it will coordinate with them through the shared local lock gateway without overwriting each other's changes.
- The agent's commits will have correct attribution (showing which agent made which change).

## Step 1. Read AGENTS.md

The `AGENTS.md` file in the repository root is the shared minimum ruleset for any file-based agent (not specific to one vendor). Most modern CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Kimi, Cline) read it automatically when opening the directory — no separate configuration is needed.

**Verification:** open the repository with the new agent and ask it directly — "did you read AGENTS.md in the repository root? List 3 rules from it." If the agent cannot answer, check whether it supports automatic reading of instruction files in the repo root (some vendors require a separate setting — see the agent documentation using the keywords "project instructions", "system prompt from file", "AGENTS.md support").

## Step 2. Determine Whether File Coordination Is Needed

Coordination is needed if another agent can work on the same repository files at the same time as this agent (e.g., a human + Claude, or multiple CLI agents in parallel).

Coordination is not needed if the agent works solo and never shares files with other agents — in that case, skip Steps 3–4 and go directly to Step 5.

## Step 3. Connect the Agent to the Local Lock Gateway

IWE uses a local MCP server (`DS-MCP/local-gateway`) that maintains a shared file lock manager. Any agent that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a client can connect to it.

### 3.1. Check Whether the Agent Supports an MCP Client

Ask the agent's documentation or the agent itself: "do you support connecting to external MCP servers as a client, and can you pass environment variables when starting the server?"

If yes — the agent typically has a subcommand such as `<agent> mcp add`, or a configuration file (`config.toml`, `config.yaml`, `settings.json`) where a new MCP server entry is added.

### 3.2. Find the Local Gateway Launch Command

If your repository's `.mcp.json` already has an `iwe-local-gateway` entry (someone connected the gateway previously) — copy the `command` and `args` from there. That is the fastest path.

If the entry does not exist yet, the gateway itself is most likely also not installed (it is not included in the template directly — it is a separate dependency with its own version lifecycle). Install it:

```bash
bash setup/optional/setup-local-gateway.sh
```

The Script clones the gateway at a pinned version, builds it, starts the daemon, and prints a ready-made `command`/`args`/`env` block for insertion into `.mcp.json`. Use this block in Step 3.3 below. The path to `proxy.js` in this block is `node <absolute-path-to-your-IWE>/DS-MCP/local-gateway/dist/proxy.js`.

**Important:** `env.IWE_AGENT_ID` in the printed block is set to the agent that ran the Script (or `claude-code` by default). When registering the **second and subsequent agents**, replace this value with a unique name for each agent (see Step 3.3 below). Duplicate `IWE_AGENT_ID` values across different agents silently breaks lock coordination.

### 3.3. Register the Agent With a Unique IWE_AGENT_ID

Each agent receives its own unique identifier via the `IWE_AGENT_ID` environment variable. The local gateway uses this to distinguish which agent holds the lock on a file. The identifier is a short name with no spaces (e.g., `codex`, `hermes`, `kimikode`, `chatgpt`).

**General registration syntax (replace placeholders for the specific agent):**

```
<agent-command> mcp add iwe-local-gateway --env IWE_AGENT_ID=<unique-agent-name> -- node <path-to-proxy.js>
```

**Three verified examples** (different agents, different registration syntax — same general principle):

```bash
# Codex (standard --env flag for stdio MCP servers)
codex mcp add iwe-local-gateway --env IWE_AGENT_ID=codex -- node /path/to/IWE/DS-MCP/local-gateway/dist/proxy.js

# Hermes (separate --command/--args/--env flags)
hermes mcp add iwe-local-gateway --command node --args /path/to/IWE/DS-MCP/local-gateway/dist/proxy.js --env IWE_AGENT_ID=hermes

# Kimi (via MCP client config, not a CLI subcommand — see docs/KIMI-SETUP.md)
```

If your agent has neither an `mcp add` CLI subcommand nor a config file for MCP clients, it **does not support MCP as a client** and coordination through the local gateway cannot be configured for it by technical means. In this case, the agent can only participate at the level of Step 1 (reading `AGENTS.md`), without file coordination. State this directly to the user — do not invent a workaround.

### 3.4. Verify Registration

```bash
<agent> mcp list
```

The output must include an `iwe-local-gateway` entry. If the agent supports calling MCP tools directly from chat, try calling `gateway_status` — the response should return `locks: []` (an empty list of active locks) if no agent is currently holding a file lock.

## Step 4. Configure Commit Attribution

Add a trailer in the following form to the agent's configuration (or use it as a flag when committing):

```
Co-Authored-By: <Agent Name> <noreply@vendor-domain>
```

For example:
- `Co-Authored-By: Codex <noreply@openai.com>`
- `Co-Authored-By: Hermes <noreply@aisystant.com>`
- `Co-Authored-By: Kimi <noreply@moonshot.cn>`

If you are unsure of the correct vendor domain, use the official product domain for the agent. After the first real commit, verify that the email does not look like a spam address and does not trigger errors in the repository's git hooks.

## Step 5. Point the Agent to IWE Skills (Optional)

If the agent has its own mechanism for loading additional instructions or skills (analogous to `.claude/skills/` in Claude Code), point it to the `.claude/skills/` directory in your repository. This mirrors how it is done for Kimi (`extra_skill_dirs` in `~/.kimi/config.toml`, see `docs/KIMI-SETUP.md`).

If no such mechanism exists, skip this step. It does not block the agent's other work.

## Connection Verification (Smoke Test)

### Codex Calling Kimi or Claude as a Peer Partner

This step is only relevant when Codex launches `kimi-peer-adapter.sh` or `claude-peer-adapter.sh` as a child process. Normal standalone operation of Kimi and Claude does not require changing the Codex sandbox.

By default, the Codex local sandbox blocks outbound network access and writes outside the working directory. Both Constraints are significant: Kimi writes state to `~/.kimi`, Claude writes to `~/.claude` and `~/.claude.json`, and both clients call their respective APIs. These permissions are sufficient for Kimi, but on macOS they may be only necessary for Claude — its active authorization may be stored in Keychain, which is inaccessible to a child process running inside the sandbox. In the user-level `~/.codex/config.toml`, keep the root keys before the first TOML section and add the required permissions:

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
writable_roots = [
  "<HOME_DIR>/.kimi",
  "<HOME_DIR>/.claude",
  "<HOME_DIR>/.claude.json"
]
```

Replace `<HOME_DIR>` with the actual home directory path. TOML does not expand `$HOME`, so a literal `"$HOME/.kimi"` does not work here. Existing root keys such as `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` must remain above `[sandbox_workspace_write]`, otherwise TOML will assign them to the wrong section.

**This is an explicit security decision:** in Codex 0.146.0, `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access = true` opens outbound network access for all commands inside that sandbox. This version does not accept `[features.network_proxy]` — do not copy settings from a newer schema without verifying against the installed binary. Specific risk: any command inside the sandbox (not just the Kimi/Claude call itself) gains full outbound network access. A tool invoked by the agent inside this sandbox can technically send data to an arbitrary external host. If broad network access is unacceptable, run the peer session from a separate trusted terminal instead of relaxing the sandbox.

If Claude inside the sandbox responds with `Not logged in · Please run /login`, do not re-run the login automatically. First, call the same adapter from a regular terminal. On macOS, this is a typical symptom of Keychain being inaccessible from an isolated process — not a lost authorization. Until the installed version of Codex provides a narrow Keychain permission, the canonical Codex→Claude path is an external trusted executor or a separate terminal with the same minimal text Projection. Do not enable `danger-full-access` just for this workaround.

After saving, fully restart Codex/VS Code and verify the configuration:

```bash
codex debug models
codex doctor
```

Then run a short live call to Kimi through the adapter. Test Claude inside the sandbox first; if a Keychain failure occurs, repeat from a trusted terminal. Successful configuration commands do not substitute for actual Kimi and Claude responses.

Run the following on a real small task:

1. **The agent sees AGENTS.md** — ask the agent directly, as described in the verification in Step 1.
2. **If gateway coordination is configured** — `<agent> mcp list` shows `iwe-local-gateway`.
3. **Real file edit with locking** (only if coordination was configured):
   - Ask the agent to call `acquire_file_lock` on any test file, make a small edit, commit with the correct trailer, then call `release_file_lock`.
   - Check the commit: `git log -1 --format="%H %s%n%b"` — it must contain `Co-Authored-By` with the correct name and domain.
   - Verify the lock is released: calling `gateway_status` must again return `locks: []`.

If any of these checks fail, do not connect the agent to file coordination until you identify the cause. An agent that commits without attribution or does not release locks creates confusion for other agents in the repository.

## Difference From "Orchestrating an Agent as a Peer Partner"

Do not confuse this connection with the wrapper adapter (`*-peer-adapter.sh`), where one agent calls another headless as a subordinate Peer partner inside a peer session (one writes, the other critiques, the entire dialogue is managed by the first agent). That is a different scenario — the calling agent orchestrates the called agent, rather than two independent MCP clients coordinating as equals through locks. The connection described in this document makes the new agent an independent participant in the repository, not a subprocess of another agent.

## Troubleshooting

1. Verify that the path to `proxy.js` in the registration command is absolute and matches the actual location of your `DS-MCP/local-gateway` clone.
2. Verify that `IWE_AGENT_ID` in the registration command is unique and does not match any already-connected agents (run `<agent> mcp list` for each already-connected agent).
3. If the agent does not support an MCP client at all, file coordination is technically impossible for it. Limit it to Step 1 (`AGENTS.md`).
4. Check the `gateway_status` output — a stuck lock (`locks` is non-empty after a long time) typically means a previous agent did not call `release_file_lock` after committing.
5. An error such as "connect ECONNREFUSED" when calling gateway tools typically means the daemon is not running — re-run `bash setup/optional/setup-local-gateway.sh`, which will check and start the daemon if needed.
