## The Problem

AI assistants can generate text, code, and answers. But most users face the same problems:

- **Context is lost.** Every new AI Session starts from scratch. Yesterday's decisions, plans, and agreements are forgotten.
- **Knowledge stays in your head.** You complete a course, read a book, solve a problem — but a month later you cannot reconstruct the reasoning.
- **AI replaces thinking instead of amplifying it.** You get an answer but do not become more competent. Without AI — back to zero.
- **No system.** Plans are in notes, tasks are in your head, Knowledge is in chats. Everything is disconnected.
- **Time slips away.** It is unclear what you worked on, what you accomplished, where you are heading.

---

## The Solution: An IDE, But for Thinking

**IWE (Intellectual Work Environment)** is an intellectual work environment.

Just as an IDE combines an editor, compiler, and debugger into one environment for a programmer — IWE combines Knowledge, planning, and AI agents into one environment for thinking.

| IDE (for code) | IWE (for thinking) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Editor → you write code | Exocortex → you capture Knowledge |
| Compiler → checks syntax | Principles → verify correctness of decisions |
| Debugger → finds errors | Opening→Work→Closing (OWC) Protocols → find Knowledge and context losses |
| Linter → improves quality | ArchGate → assesses architectural decisions |
| Git → change history | Strategist → work history and planning |

> **Key principle: exoskeleton, not prosthesis.** IWE amplifies your thinking — it does not replace it. After every Session you become more competent, not merely the recipient of a result. More: [principles-vs-skills.md](docs/principles-vs-skills.md).

## Key IWE Terms

| Term | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| **Exocortex** | Your external Memory — files containing plans, context, and conclusions that Claude reads in every Session |
| **Pack** | A formalized Knowledge base for your Domain — the single source of truth for domain Knowledge |
| **OWC** | Opening → Work → Closing — a ritual for every Session and every day; prevents context loss |
| **ArchGate** | Structured Assessment of architectural decisions across 7 characteristics (instead of "I think this looks fine") |
| **Strategist** | An AI agent that automatically creates day/week plans and tracks Progress |


---

## Work Culture — A New Way to Interact With AI


### The OWC Protocol (Opening → Work → Closing)

Every Session and every day passes through three stages:

- **Opening** — Claude reviews the plan, identifies the task, and aligns on the approach. You do not start work "from scratch" — the AI knows the context.
- **Work** — as work proceeds, Claude captures valuable Knowledge (Capture-to-Pack). Insights are not lost.
- **Closing** — the result is recorded, the plan is updated, and the next Session starts where you left off.

Skipping Opening = unplanned work. Skipping Closing = lost result.

### Exocortex — External Memory

Your Knowledge, principles, Distinctions, plans, and context are stored in files that Claude reads in every Session. This is not a "prompt" — it is an **accumulated base** that grows with you.

### Knowledge Formalization (Pack)

What you learn does not stay in your head. Valuable Knowledge is formalized into a Pack — the Domain passport. Pack is the single source of truth for domain Knowledge. More: [LEARNING-PATH.md](docs/LEARNING-PATH.md).

---

## Who It Is For

Every professional drowns in information: 12+ tools (Notion, Google Docs, Slack, ChatGPT, courses…), Knowledge is scattered, nothing is connected. AI answers questions but does not know *your* context — starting from zero every time.

IWE is for those who want to change that:

- **Entrepreneurs and managers** — you strategize, make decisions, manage projects. IWE provides a system: from weekly planning to formalizing Domain Knowledge.
- **Engineers and developers** — you work with code and Architecture. IWE preserves context between Sessions; the AI knows your codebase, technical debt, and Roadmap.
- **Researchers and analysts** — you study, synthesize, and publish. IWE transforms scattered notes into a structured Knowledge base that grows with you.
- **Anyone doing intellectual work** — who wants **symbiosis with AI**, not dependency on it. An exoskeleton for thinking, not a prosthesis.

## Use Cases

### Work Projects

| Scenario | What happens | More |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Product development** | Claude knows the Architecture, technical debt, and Roadmap. Every Session continues where the last one ended — not from scratch. | [SC.013](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc013-work-session-with-claude-code), [SC.015](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc015-system-development-ds) |
| **Documentation** | Knowledge is captured in the Pack during work. No need to "write docs later" — they are written while working. | [SC.004](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc004-knowledge-capture-and-extraction), [SC.014](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc014-knowledge-formalization-pack) |
| **Project coordination** | WeekPlan, DayPlan, Work Product registry — the Strategist helps plan and track Progress. | [SC.001](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc001-day-planning), [SC.002](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc002-week-planning-and-review) |
| **Review and Refactoring** | ArchGate assesses decisions across 7 characteristics. Not "I think this is fine" — a structured Assessment. | [SC.015](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc015-system-development-ds) |

### Personal Development

| Scenario | What happens | More |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Taking a course** | Claude helps capture key ideas, asks questions to check Understanding, and connects new material to what you already know. | [SC.003](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc003-learning-and-development) |
| **Writing articles** | A creative Pipeline: note → draft → outline → publication. Every Artifact is tracked. | [SC.005](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc005-content-publication) |
| **Strategizing** | Weekly Session: Review of the past week, planning the new one, checking against goals. The Strategist prepares a draft — you make the decisions. | [SC.011](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc011-strategizing) |
| **Building a Knowledge base** | Your Pack grows. After six months you have a formalized Domain Knowledge base, not a collection of notes. | [SC.014](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc014-knowledge-formalization-pack) |

> Full catalog of 15 scenarios: **[USE-CASES.md](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md)**

## What It Looks Like in Practice

- In the morning — the Strategist has prepared a plan: a Telegram notification + a DayPlan file in the Repository.
- You open VS Code → `claude` → Claude knows what is in the plan and suggests starting with the top Priority.
- You work — Claude captures Knowledge along the way (Capture-to-Pack).
- You close the Session — the result is recorded, the plan is updated.
- On Monday — the Strategist prepares a draft weekly plan; you discuss it in the strategizing Session.

## Machine Requirements

A minimum of **4 GiB of free RAM** is required while Claude Code (or another agent) is running on top of IWE. With less memory — especially on shared servers with multiple users — file read/write tools may intermittently fail with a message such as `PreToolUse hook did not respond before its timeout`. This message indicates insufficient host-process memory, not a broken template Hook (issue [#461](https://github.com/iwesys/IWE/issues/461)) — `bash scripts/iwe-audit.sh` shows the current available memory level under the "Available memory" section.

## Getting Started

**Quick start** (Git, Node.js, Claude Code already installed): **[QUICK-START.md](docs/QUICK-START.md)** — 15 minutes to your first Session.

**Full installation** from a clean machine: **[SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)** — 30–60 minutes including all dependencies.

**Not on macOS or not using Claude Code?** See **[PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md)** — instructions for Kimi Code, Hermes Agent, and others.

**Different agent or LLM?** IWE is not tied to Claude. If your agent can see files in the repo folder and edit files, it will work. How to connect → [PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/IWE && cd ~/IWE
gh repo fork iwesys/IWE --clone
cd FMT-exocortex-template
bash setup.sh
```

After installation:

```bash
cd ~/IWE
claude
```

Tell Claude: **"Let's run our first strategic Session"** — and it will guide you through defining goals, creating your first plan, and configuring the Environment.

---

## Customization

IWE updates like a distribution — you receive platform updates without losing your settings.

**Extensions (extensions/)** — add your own blocks to Protocols:

```bash
# Add end-of-day reflection
echo "## Day Reflection
- What was difficult?
- What would I do differently?
- What deserves acknowledgment?" > extensions/day-close.after.md
```

**Parameters (params.yaml)** — enable or disable Protocol Steps:

```yaml
reflection_enabled: true    # Enable reflection
video_check: false          # Disable video check
multiplier_enabled: true    # IWE multiplier
```

**Updates** — `bash update.sh` updates the platform while preserving your extensions/, params.yaml, and edits in CLAUDE.md (3-way merge).

## FAQ

**Q: Is an Anthropic subscription required?**
A: For the full installation (Claude Code) — Claude Pro ($20/month) is recommended. You can upgrade to Claude Max (~$100/month) for unlimited work if needed. For the minimal installation (`setup.sh --core`) — works with any AI CLI. More: [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

**Q: Does it work with other AI systems (not Claude)?**
A: Yes, three agents are supported out of the box:
- **Claude Code** — full support: reads `CLAUDE.md`, all Skills and Hooks work.
- **Kimi Code** (VS Code) — reads `AGENTS.md` automatically when the repo is opened. Customization: `extensions/` or `AGENTS-agent-blocks.md`. Skills (`/day-open` etc.) via Claude Code.
- **Hermes Agent** — connect Aisystant MCP through Hermes settings and it receives instructions automatically.

Other agents (Cursor, Copilot, Gemini) require adaptation. More: [PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md).
The minimal installation (`setup.sh --core`) works without binding to a specific agent.

**Q: Does it work on Linux/Windows?**
A: Yes. The core runs on any OS. Strategist automation: macOS — launchd, Linux — systemd (user units), cloud option (OS-independent) — GitHub Actions. Windows: `setup.sh` and the core run via Git Bash (installed with Git for Windows) — WSL is not required; WSL remains a fallback for those who prefer a full Linux layer. Not tested live on real Windows (no Windows runner in CI) — details and an honest caveat: [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md) § Windows.

**Q: What if the computer is off or asleep — does automation stop?**
A: Cloud Scheduler (GitHub Actions) runs in the cloud even when your computer is off. For local agents: scripts automatically prevent sleep during execution (macOS: `caffeinate`, Linux: `systemd-inhibit`). For laptops, it is recommended to configure automatic wake and disable idle sleep — see [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

**Q: What is a Pack?**
A: A formalized Knowledge Domain — the single source of truth for domain Knowledge. More: [LEARNING-PATH.md](docs/LEARNING-PATH.md).

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Three protection zones: local, GitHub (private repositories), platform (per-user isolation). More: [DATA-POLICY.md](docs/DATA-POLICY.md).

**Q: How is IWE different from Obsidian / Notion / Logseq?**
A: Obsidian is a note store. IWE is a **work environment** with Protocols, AI agents, and Knowledge formalization. You can use Obsidian inside IWE for notes, but IWE provides structure, planning, and Competency accumulation.

**Q: Is programming required?**
A: No. The template is a ready-made Configuration. Installation is via setup.sh. Work is via Claude Code in natural language.

**Q: Can it be used without the Strategist?**
A: Yes. Claude Code + CLAUDE.md + memory/ work fully. The Strategist is planning automation. Without it, you plan manually.

**Q: How do I configure the strategizing day?**
A: In `memory/day-rhythm-config.yaml`, change `strategy_day: sunday` to the desired day. More: [LEARNING-PATH.md](docs/LEARNING-PATH.md).

**Q: The clone ended up in `~` instead of `~/IWE`?**
A: All installation commands must be run in the same terminal. Opening a new terminal starts from `~`. Delete the folder from `~` and repeat starting with `cd ~/IWE`. More: [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

## IWE Community

IWE is an environment you build alone. But you develop it together.

The **IWE community** is a closed chat for Practitioners working within the same system: OWC, Pack, Exocortex. A place where the discussion is not "how to prompt better" but how to build serious intellectual work.

### What happens there

- **Work Product reviews** — participants share real Packs, plans, and Retrospectives. They receive feedback from people who understand what "Closing without recording the result" means.
- **Experience with IWE installation and customization** — what broke, how it was fixed, which extensions proved useful.
- **Method discussions** — the OWC fractal, ArchGate, Capture-to-Pack in practice: what works, where theory diverges from reality.
- **Links and discoveries** — tools, patterns, SOTA that fit the IWE philosophy.

### Why this matters

You can study the system alone. But most questions arise at the application stage: "How do I formalize this Knowledge Domain?", "Am I using OWC correctly?", "Who has experience with this tool?"

In the community, those questions get answers from people who have already been through it.

### Free channels

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/iwesys/IWE/discussions) — questions, ideas, show your setup.
- [Issues](https://github.com/iwesys/IWE/issues) — bug reports and feature requests.

### Closed community (Telegram)

Deep practice, Work Product reviews, direct support. Entry is via the **"IWE for Practitioners"** seminar (5000₽) in the bot [@aist_me_bot](https://t.me/aist_me_bot).
