# FMT-exocortex-template Release Process

> Who bumps the template version, when, and how. Goal: a clear "ready to release" criterion
> instead of a verbal agreement. Source: WP-347 Phase 3, 22 May 2026.
> **Weekly auto-bump** added by WP-5 (20 July 2026) — see "Regular Release" below.

## What "release" means

`update.sh` operates through the `release` channel by default: an update locks to the latest
published GitHub Release (a tag; when Python is available, the tag is additionally resolved to a
commit SHA). A commit to `main` reaches users only after the next release is published. If no
release can be resolved, the update stops (fail-closed) — there is no automatic fallback to
`main`. The `main` channel (`IWE_UPDATE_CHANNEL=main`) is a moving branch for the author workflow.

**Version** in `update-manifest.json["version"]` is an informational label — it is displayed
when running `bash update.sh` as "Exocortex updates (vX.Y.Z)", and is also fetched with
`--check` from the remote manifest for comparison with the local value. Bumping the version is
a signal that "this set of changes is stabilized — time to update."

## Regular release (weekly-release.yml)

Before WP-5 (20 July 2026), version bumps were manual only — gaps between releases reached
2–3 weeks, even though commits appeared in the `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section almost daily.
The reason: the user notification in the bot is generated as a summary of the CHANGELOG and
stays pending until someone draws the line manually.

**`.github/workflows/weekly-release.yml`** — on a schedule (Sunday 20:00 UTC) checks whether
the `[Unreleased]` section in CHANGELOG.md is non-empty. If it is, the workflow bumps the
patch version (`X.Y.Z` → `X.Y.(Z+1)`) in `update-manifest.json`, flushes `[Unreleased]`
via `scripts/changelog-flush.sh`, and commits. The commit triggers `release.yml` — the tag
and GitHub Release are created automatically.

**Manual bumps are still possible** for minor/major versions (new feature, breaking change) or
for an unplanned release. The readiness criteria and steps below remain in force; the auto-bump
simply applies them automatically at the patch level once a week instead of waiting for a
manual decision.

---

## Version bump readiness criteria

All items must be completed:

- [ ] CI is green (`Validate Template` + all jobs)
- [ ] No open hotfix branches (`git branch --list 'hotfix/*'` — empty)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is filled in: the `[Unreleased]` section is non-empty, no "TODO" lines
- [ ] All new files are added to `update-manifest.json["files"]`
  (`git ls-files | python3 scripts/check-manifest-coverage.py update-manifest.json`)
- [ ] `deprecated_files` complies with the convention (see "deprecated_files convention" below)
- [ ] fix commits since the last bump ≤ 5 (if > 5 → mandatory instability review required, see "Stability metric" section)

---

## Stability metric

The number of fix commits since the last version bump serves as a proxy metric for codebase
stability. A threshold of ≤ 5 means that accumulated instability is not yet critical and the
release can proceed without an additional review; exceeding the threshold requires an explicit
risk assessment.

```bash
# Count fix commits since the last version bump
# Branch A — tags exist (normal path):
LAST_TAG=$(git tag --list 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1)
if [ -n "$LAST_TAG" ]; then
  COUNT=$(git log "$LAST_TAG"..HEAD --oneline | grep -cE '^[a-f0-9]+ (fix|hotfix)(\(|: )' || true)
else
  # Branch B — no tags (legacy, remove 2 releases after tags are restored):
  LAST_MANIFEST_BUMP=$(git log -2 --format=%H -- update-manifest.json | sed -n '2p')
  if [ -z "$LAST_MANIFEST_BUMP" ]; then
    echo "ℹ️  No previous manifest bump — skipping fix-metric check (first release)"
    exit 0
  fi
  COUNT=$(git log "$LAST_MANIFEST_BUMP"..HEAD --oneline | grep -cE '^[a-f0-9]+ (fix|hotfix)(\(|: )' || true)
fi
echo "fix commits: $COUNT"
if [ "$COUNT" -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  >5 fixes — instability review required before bumping"
  exit 1
fi
```

> Fallback branch B is removed 2 releases after normal tagging is restored.

## Version bump steps

```bash
# 1. Verify CI is green, pull latest changes
git pull --rebase

# 2. Determine the new version (semver: patch = fixes, minor = new skill/feature)
NEW_VERSION="0.35.0"

# 3. Bump the version in the manifest
python3 - "$NEW_VERSION" <<'EOF'
import json, sys
with open('update-manifest.json', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    m = json.load(f)
m['version'] = sys.argv[1]
with open('update-manifest.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(m, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
    f.write('\n')
print(f"version bumped to {sys.argv[1]}")
EOF

# 4. Update CHANGELOG.md: rename [Unreleased] → [X.Y.Z] and add a new [Unreleased] section
# Template:
# ## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD
# ### What's new
# - brief description
# ## [Unreleased]

# 5. Commit + push
git add update-manifest.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: release $NEW_VERSION"
git push
```

## Release owner

The template author (`author_mode: true` in `params.yaml`). A release is a synchronous step
and cannot be delegated to agents without explicit authorization. Cadence: as changes accumulate,
target approximately once per week when significant changes are present.

Release signal: ≥ 1 feature or ≥ 3 fixes in `[Unreleased]`.

---

## `deprecated_files` convention

An entry in `deprecated_files` means: **the file has ALREADY been deleted from the repository
or is no longer in use.** This does NOT mean "planning to delete" or "migrating soon."

**Rule:**

1. Delete a file from the repository → add it to `deprecated_files` in the same commit.
2. Manually verify that no script or hook in the repository references that path:
   ```bash
   grep -r "path/to/deprecated-file" . --include="*.sh" --include="*.md" --include="*.json"
   ```
   Detector 10 in `integration-contract-validator.sh` catches this case for
   `roles/strategist/prompts/` — but only for that file subset.
   For all other deprecated files, a manual check is mandatory.
3. Using `deprecated_files` as a TODO tracker ("we will remove this soon") is prohibited:
   after `update.sh` runs, the user will not receive the new file, but the old one is already
   removed from delivery.

**Why this matters:** if `deprecated_files` contains a file that the runner still uses, the
runner will fail with "file not found" after `update.sh` (precedent: `af3b15c`, strategist
roles, 22 May 2026).

## Checklist when adding a new file to FMT

For every `git add <new-file>`, verify:

1. The file is added to `update-manifest.json["files"]` (otherwise users will not receive it).
   CI check: `git ls-files | python3 scripts/check-manifest-coverage.py update-manifest.json`.
2. If the file is intentionally NOT intended for delivery — add it to `excluded_paths` or to
   one of the excluded directories (`.github/`, `setup/`, `seed/`, `extensions/`, `templates/`).
3. If the file is a `.sh` script — run `bash scripts/validate-fmt-scripts.sh scripts/` to check
   for hardcoded values and unsafe arithmetic under `set -e`.

## Full git mirror of the template with its own CI — NOT supported (issue #850)

A full `git clone`/fork of this repository (as opposed to installing via `setup.sh` +
`update.sh`) receives `.github/workflows/*`, including `validate-template.yml`, together with
ALL repository contents at the time of cloning — including files from `excluded_paths`
(for example `setup/smoke-test-fresh-install.sh`), which are intended as internal dev/CI
files of the canon, not part of delivery.

If such a mirror is then updated via `update.sh --yes` (rather than `git pull` from upstream),
`update.sh` keeps only the files listed in `files`/delegated directories up to date;
`excluded_paths` files, once cloned, are never updated again. Workflow files that reference
`excluded_paths` tests (`validate-template.yml` calls `smoke-test-fresh-install.sh`) continue
to run in such a mirror on `push`, but over time they compare the current workflow against a
stale copy of the test — a failure in this scenario does not mean delivery is broken.

**This configuration is not supported.** Results from `validate-template.yml` in such a mirror
are not meaningful; compare against a run on the canon
(`TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template`) at the same commit/version before treating a
difference as a real defect.
